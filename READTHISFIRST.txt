Hey everyone! what you see on this repository is basically evidence that regex (owner of recorders) is actually a scammer/blackmailer/bans ppl for no reason and some more stuff that I cab mentioning. I decided to update this repo so anyone who doesn’t know about what happened (or has been brainwashed by regexs lies) gets a transparent view of what actually happened. Ill be more than happy to answer any question that isn’t covered here and keep updating this repo but for now ill guide you :D

For the free vitamins export file, double click it and ctrl + f the following:

Since vip purge i feel like other staff should hold money aswell

//READ all the way down from here

Feel free to read all but it doesnt really have much value to this anyways



For the Devious client - general export file, double click it and ctrl + f the following:

also stop logging peoples discord accounts and stuff!

//READ all the way down from here till you reach "how many ppl have u ignored/banned from server for just pming u”

Once done with that, do ctrl + f the following (yes there’s some proof in it viral isn’t sox or mono):

since viral and sox uses sythe, cant this be asked to a sythe admin to see if thers a link

//READ all the way down from here till you reach “And u better fucking exit scam”

Okay, I guess your view is decent now, but there’s more. Ill update this repo with ppl that has gotten banned for just ping him x plugin isn’t working/unfair punishments etc. I also received a report that he’s stealing sensitive info like passwords which ill look at, I would also like to remember you guys that r3g3x or w/e u wanna call him is not the guy (you guys got ip logged by one or more cracks he released) and all plugin providers knows who’s running a cracked client.
